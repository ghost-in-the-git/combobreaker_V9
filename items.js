/**
 * ITEMS CONFIGURATION
 *
 * Edit this file to add, remove, or modify items.
 *
 * Each item has:
 * - name: Display name
 * - type: "body", "legs", "arms", "weapon", "chip", "processor", "pilot", "drill", "implant", or "mindsync"
 * - desc: Flavour text shown when installed
 * - image: Image path for the item icon
 * - stats: Object with stat bonuses { hp, defence, speed, attack, breaker }
 * - dropRate: Relative chance to drop (higher = more common)
 * - droppedBy: Array of enemy names that can drop this item (empty = all enemies in zone)
 * - cost: Silicon cost to purchase from shops
 * - zone: Location key where this item drops and is sold (omit for special items)
 *
 * STANDARD ITEM SCALING (Tiers 1-10, one stat per slot):
 *   body: +10 HP per tier (10, 20, 30 ... 100)
 *   legs: +1 SPD per tier (1, 2, 3 ... 10)
 *   arms: +1 DEF per tier (1, 2, 3 ... 10)
 *   weapon: +1 ATK per tier (1, 2, 3 ... 10)
 *   chip: +1 BREAKER per tier (1, 2, 3 ... 10)
