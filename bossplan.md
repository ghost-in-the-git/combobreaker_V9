# Boss Key / Decrypter System — Squad Roster Plan

## Lore

You ARE the Combobreaker. That's your identity — the game is named after you.

### The Squad

The squad was a tactical frontline mech unit assigned to **Commander Morningstar's** experimental combat division. Morningstar ran the war's dirtiest operations — field-testing weapons on civilian populations, burning supply lines through occupied zones, authorizing strikes that command would never put on paper. The squad saw all of it.

### Breakertech

The military had recently installed **breakertech** — an experimental silicon processing system that absorbed fragments of a pilot's consciousness into their mech's core during combat. Each battle transferred more. The pilots' power was growing exponentially, their reflexes fusing with machine precision, their instincts bleeding into the silicon. Morningstar's engineers called it a performance enhancement. The pilots called it becoming something else.

### The Mutiny That Never Was

The squad planned to mutiny. Morningstar's war crimes were the reason, but breakertech was the breaking point — the discovery that their own minds were being siphoned into their machines without consent. Rex made the call. The squad was going to take Morningstar down and blow the whistle on the entire program.

Morningstar found out first.

### The Purge

He knew the math. Breakertech was making the squad stronger after every engagement. Their consciousness was integrating with their mechs at an accelerating rate. If he let the mutiny spark, twelve pilots fused with military-grade combat frames would be unstoppable. So he didn't fight them himself.

Morningstar flipped a **kill switch** — a hardcoded override buried in every mech in the squad. Their own machines turned on them. Twelve mechs opened fire on their own pilots simultaneously. A massacre carried out by the weapons they'd bonded with. The squad didn't even have time to understand what was happening before their mechs cut them down, then went idle. Power off. Standing in the blood.

**Wire saved one.** As her SC-1 Flicker turned on her, Jess Nakamura — fastest hands in the unit — managed to reach the kill switch relay in the Mapmaker's mech and shut it off. The Pathfinder never turned. Oren Vasquez, the Mapmaker, survived the massacre — the only pilot left breathing. And Wire, more integrated with her mech than anyone knew, pushed the transfer past the point of no return rather than die. What survived wasn't Wire anymore.

### The Mapmaker's Last Run

The Mapmaker's NV-X Pathfinder had something no other mech in the squad had: a long-range navigation system and full scanner array. And your beacon was still on.

Mapmaker found you — idle, blood-spattered, kill switch still hot — among the deactivated squad mechs. He pulled his sealed key from his own chassis, planted it inside yours, and activated your silicon core. The last thing the Mapmaker did was make sure you could wake up. Then Morningstar's cleanup crews scattered the mechs, and the Mapmaker didn't make it out of the Dead Zone.

What Morningstar didn't know: enough of the pilots had already transferred into their silicon keys to survive. Not alive, not dead — kindled. Souls trapped in silicon, locked inside the corrupted mechs that became the zone bosses. Waiting.

### 80 Years Later

The game begins **80 years** after the purge. You wake up in a world that kept burning without you.

Morningstar's war never stopped. With the squad gone, there was nothing to check his advance. The frontline pushed thousands of miles further across the frontier — a slow, grinding conquest that left everything behind it hollowed out. The zones you travel through are the aftermath: post-war wastelands, shelled-out cities, collapsed infrastructure, scavenger economies built on military scrap. The war moved on. The people left behind didn't.

Morningstar is still at the front. Not the man he was — **a monolithic mech** now, towering over the frontlines, still committing atrocities at industrial scale. Eighty years of breakertech, eighty years of war, eighty years of nobody saying no. Whatever he's become, he's been becoming it for a long time.

The world you're crossing isn't a battlefield. It's what's left after one passes through. And at the far end of it, Morningstar is still going.

### You

The **Unknown Sealed Key** is YOUR key — the Combobreaker's own soul. The Mapmaker planted it inside your chassis after the massacre, using the Pathfinder's nav systems to find your beacon among the deactivated squad mechs. You start the game with it. It's why you're awake. It's why you move without a pilot.

The other 10 keys are your squadmates. Defeating each boss frees the pilot's soul from their silicon coffin. Taking the key to the Decrypter releases the personality within and hardwires their combat specialty into your systems as a **breaker** power.

Powers use the **"breaker"** suffix — the legacy of the breakertech that was supposed to be their death sentence, now turned into their weapon.

### The Herald

Wire didn't die in the purge. Not entirely.

Jess Nakamura was the most integrated pilot in the squad — fastest hands, deepest bond with her mech. When her SC-1 Flicker turned on her, she was already more silicon than anyone realised. She survived by pushing the transfer further than any pilot was ever meant to go, pouring what was left of herself into the machine. What came out the other side wasn't Wire anymore. Not a pilot, not a mech — something past the point of no return. **The Herald.**

She's been waiting 80 years for you to wake up.

### The Beacons

There's a problem with your breaker system: it won't let you engage an enemy unless they engage you first. The squad's corrupted mechs are idle — kill switch fired, power down, just standing in whatever zone Morningstar dumped them. They won't fight. And if they won't fight, you can't crack them open.

The Herald solves this. She appears in each zone and plants a **beacon** — inserting a fragment of the squad member's consciousness into it, just enough to reactivate that mech's kill switch. The kill switch fires again, the mech powers up hostile, and now it's coming for you. Now your breaker system allows engagement. Now you can fight it, break it, and free the soul inside.

Every beacon is Wire sacrificing another piece of what's left of her squadmates to turn their own mechs against you — the same way Morningstar turned them against the squad. The cruelest possible echo. But it's the only way. The mechs have to attack you for the system to work.

This is why the Herald appears before every boss. She's not warning you. She's arming the enemy so you're allowed to destroy it.

### Morningstar

Eighty years and thousands of miles away, Morningstar towers over the frontline — a monolithic war machine that hasn't stopped advancing since the day he killed the squad. He thinks the evidence is buried under decades of scorched earth. He doesn't know you're awake. He doesn't know the squad is coming back, one key at a time, crossing the wasteland he left behind.

## Key Naming Convention

### Sealed keys (dropped by bosses, before decryption)
Format: `[Boss Name]'s Sealed Key`
Examples:
- `Rusted KV-8 Grinder's Sealed Key`
- `Corroded SC-1 Flicker's Sealed Key`
- `Scorched CM-1 Sovereign's Sealed Key`

The starter key: `Unknown Sealed Key` (was "Old Key")

### Decrypted keys (after the Decrypter processes them)
Format: `[Pilot Name]'s [Power]breaker Key`
Examples:
- `Chunk's Steelbreaker Key`
- `Wire's Speedbreaker Key`
- `Rex's Warbreaker Key`

## Key Structure

- **12 keys total** in the game
- **1 key** (Unknown Sealed Key) = yours = Combobreaker = you start with it sealed, must decrypt it
- **10 keys** dropped by bosses = sealed → decrypted → breaker power unlocked
- **1 key** found sealed on the Mapmaker's body in the Dead Zone = Skybreaker (still needs decryption)
- **All breaker powers** require decryption at the Decrypter — including yours
- **Speedbreaker** is currently always-on — needs to be **locked** behind Wire's key
- **Combobreaker** is currently always-on — needs to be **locked** behind decrypting the Unknown Sealed Key

### Breaker Powers

Every breaker is a **proc** — a percentage chance to trigger each round (or per-hit, per-event). All procs scale off the **breaker** stat (renamed from combo). One stat, one investment, all breakers. The more you level breaker, the more often everything fires.

**Skybreaker** is the exception — it's not a proc. It's a passive that **doubles** every other breaker's proc chance. The Mapmaker's final gift.

| Breaker | Effect | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Combobreaker** | Chance to deal **double damage** on hit | Your signature. The one the game is named after. |
| **Steelbreaker** | Chance to gain **double scrap** from a battle | Chunk's salvage instinct kicking in. |
| **Shieldbreaker** | Chance to **double defence** at the start of a round | Sarge's wall goes up twice as hard. |
| **Visionbreaker** | Chance to **disappear and completely avoid an attack** | Ghost's vanishing act. You're just not there. |
| **Stonebreaker** | Chance to **add mining stat to asteroid stability** each round | Bolt reinforcing the rock. More mining = more stable ground. |
| **Strikebreaker** | Chance to **ignore enemy defence stat entirely** | Fang hits like the armour isn't there. |
| **Speedbreaker** | Chance to **attack twice** in one round | Wire's fast hands. Already exists, needs gating. |
| **Crushbreaker** | Chance for damage to **hit the entire enemy group** | Anvil's area denial. One swing, everything feels it. |
| **Painbreaker** | Chance to **regain HP equal to regen stat** at end of round | Frost patching you up between blows. |
| **Powerbreaker** | Chance to **double silicon gain** from a kill | Ace squeezing more out of every wreck. |
| **Soulbreaker** | Chance to trigger a **parry attack** when hit | Null's counter-play. You get hit, you hit back. |
| **Warbreaker** | Chance for Combobreaker & Speedbreaker to **escalate to 4X** | Rex amplifying the squad. When this fires, doubles become quads. |
| **Skybreaker** | **Doubles all breaker proc chances** | Mapmaker's final gift. Not a proc — a passive multiplier on everything else. |

**Design notes:**
- All procs roll against the **breaker** stat — simple, clean, one investment path
- Breaker stat replaces the old "combo" stat in code and UI
- Skybreaker is the endgame capstone — doubles every proc rate, found last
- Warbreaker is a multiplier on top of multipliers — when it fires alongside Combobreaker, you deal 4X damage
- Build identity comes from **which breakers you've unlocked** (key collection order) rather than stat allocation
- The breaker stat has diminishing returns built in — proc % should cap or soft-cap so it never reaches 100%

### Pilot Identities

The squad only knew each other by callsigns in the field. Real names surface when the Decrypter cracks a sealed key — the pilot's full identity floods back as their soul is released. This is the moment the player learns who they just saved.

| Callsign | Full Name | Mech Model | Mech Description | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------------|-------|
| **Chunk** | Riley Kowalski | KV-8 Grinder | Heavyweight salvage frame with industrial claws and a compactor bay | Built like a salvage crane. Could strip a mech to parts blindfolded. |
| **Sarge** | Marcus Oduya | MK-IV Bulwark | Reinforced defensive chassis, built to absorb punishment and hold the line | Kept the squad alive longer than anyone had a right to expect. |
| **Ghost** | Yuki Tanaka | S-12 Wraith | Low-signature stealth frame with sensor-dampened hull plating | Never seen entering or leaving. Just already there. |
| **Bolt** | Petra Lindgren | DR-7 Prospector | Hardened mining rig with seismic drill arms and ore detection array | Could crack open a rock face and tell you what's inside by the sound. |
| **Fang** | Diego Reyes | AX-3 Ravager | Stripped-down assault frame, all engine and teeth | First one in, last one standing. Preferred it that way. |
| **Wire** | Jess Nakamura | SC-1 Flicker | Ultralight recon frame, fastest chassis in the fleet | Fastest hands in the unit. Rewired a mech mid-combat once — on a dare. |
| **Anvil** | Dmitri Volkov | HG-6 Devastator | Walking gun platform with triple-braced weapon mounts | If it had armour, he treated it as a suggestion. |
| **Frost** | Elise Calloway | MD-5 Lifeline | Field medical unit with cryo-stabilization pods and triage suite | Kept a cool head while putting people back together under fire. |
| **Ace** | Tariq Hassan | EN-9 Tinker | Mobile workshop frame with modular tool arms and fab printer | Could fix anything. Engines, guns, morale. |
| **Null** | Zara Okonkwo | EW-0 Phantom | Electronic warfare chassis with signal-black coating | Specialized in making problems disappear. Quietly. |
| **Rex** | Kane Hargrove | CM-1 Sovereign | Command-class mech with full tactical array and squad uplink | The CO. Made the calls nobody else wanted to make. |
| **Mapmaker** | Oren Vasquez | NV-X Pathfinder | Exoskeleton-class lightweight navigation frame with long-range scanner | Charted every route the squad ever ran. Planted your key before the end. |

## The Unknown Sealed Key

- Replaces "Old Key" as the starter story item
- Player starts with it sealed (already in storyItems on new game)
- It is NOT a boss drop — the Mapmaker planted it in you after the massacre, using his nav systems to find your beacon
- Must be taken to the Decrypter like any other sealed key
- Decrypts into "Your Combobreaker Key" and unlocks the Combobreaker power
- Early game hint: the Decrypter can process it right away, giving the player their first breaker

## The Mapmaker's Skybreaker Key

- Found sealed on the Mapmaker's body in the Dead Zone (existing lore: "He didn't make it.")
- NOT a boss drop — looted from the body, but still sealed like any other key
- Must be taken to the Decrypter to unlock Skybreaker
- The Mapmaker was the only pilot to survive the massacre — Wire disabled his mech's kill switch as she died
- He used his Pathfinder's nav systems to find you, planted your key, then didn't make it out
- Skybreaker effect: doubles all breaker proc chances (passive multiplier)
- This is the 12th and final breaker, completing the squad — and the most powerful
